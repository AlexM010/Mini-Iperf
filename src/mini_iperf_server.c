/*
 * mini_iperf_server.c
 * 
 * This file is part of the Mini-Iperf project, which is a lightweight implementation
 * of a client-server model for testing network performance.
 * 
 * This file implements the server-side functionality. The server listens on a specified
 * port (8080 by default) for incoming client connections, receives data from the client,
 * and prints the received data to the console.
 * 
 * The corresponding client implementation can be found in the `mini_iperf_client.c` file.
 * Together, these files demonstrate basic socket programming in C.
